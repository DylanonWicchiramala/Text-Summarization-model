Although untouchability among Hindus is widely documented and debated, its existence among India is Muslims is rarely discussed. One reason possibly is that Islam does not recognise caste, and promotes equality and egalitarianism. Most of India is 140 million Muslims are descended from local converts. Many of them converted to Islam to escape Hindu upper-caste oppression. 'Lived reality' Their descendants form the overwhelming majority - 75% - of the present Indian Muslim population, and they are called the Dalit Muslims, according to Ejaz Ali, leader of an organisation representing socially disadvantaged Muslims. \"But caste and untouchability is a lived reality for Muslims living in India and South Asia,\" Dr Aftab Alam, a political scientist who has worked on the subject, told me. \"And untouchability is the community is worst-kept secret.\" Studies have claimed that \"concepts of purity and impurity; clean and unclean castes\" do exist among Muslims groups. A book by Ali Anwar says while Dalits are called asprishya (untouchable) in Hindu society, they are called arzal (inferior) among the Muslims. A 2009 study by Dr Alam found there was not a single \"Dalit Muslim\" in any of the prominent Muslim organisations, which were dominated essentially by four \"upper-caste\" Muslim groups. Now a major study - possibly the first its kind - by a group of researchers reveals that the scourge of untouchability is alive and well among Indian Muslims. Prashant K Trivedi, Srinivas Goli, Fahimuddin and Surinder Kumar polled more than 7,000 households across 14 districts between October 2014 and April 2015 in the populous northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. 'Food from different plates' Some of their findings include: Caste-related prejudices are found among all religious communities - including Sikhs - in India. Parsis are possibly an exception. \"But a belief that caste is a Hindu phenomenon since caste system derives legitimacy from Hindu religious texts, has dominated thinking of governments and academia since the colonial period,\" says Prashant K Trivedi. So he and his co-researchers believe that \"Dalit Muslims\" - and Christians - deserve affirmative action benefits like their Hindu outcaste counterparts. The moral of the story: you can try to leave caste in India, but caste refuses to leave you.\",\"Conservative Matt Warman apologised to those attending a public meeting in Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, telling them: \"Government exists to prevent the kind of flooding we saw.\" Almost 600 homes were evacuated when the River Steeping burst its banks. Residents have demanded answers about what happened and solutions to stop flooding happening again. Mr Warman, MP for Boston and Skegness, said that no-one was \"proud to be in this position\". \"It exists to try and protect people who are vulnerable and I want to admit, first off, that it is a failure that we are in this position. \"It is a failure we are in this position - largely down to a whole load of factors. But I am not standing saying any of us are proud to be in this position. \"So that is a flat-out  isorry'.\" According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Warman said that he had approached Environment Secretary Michael Gove \"who had agreed funding would be made available\" to improve flood defences in the area. RAF helicopters were drafted in to drop bags of ballast in a £1m operation to fill a breach in the riverbank after the equivalent of two months' rain fell in two days. Angry residents at the meeting claimed that a lack of dredging of the river to remove silt had led to the flooding. One woman said that affected residents \"want answers\". \"Somebody somewhere has got to take responsibility,\" she said. \"Not just for my home but for everybody else is homes that have been flooded.\" Leigh Edwin, from the Environment Agency, said he understood why people were \"angry\" but said that dredging would not have prevented the flooding. \"It is important that we choose the right solution to get to a better place,\" he said. \"And the hard fact is that de-silting alone of this river would not have prevented what happened.\" Residents at the meeting on Thursday night called for any independent review to be carried out by an external body. They were told it would be carried out by another council.\",\"The novel scheme is needed to help the net support more users and many more smart devices and gadgets. Now more than 10% of net users are visiting websites using the new system, statistics suggest. Called IPv6, the protocol replaces an the older version whose pool of addresses is almost depleted. The figures were gathered by search giant Google, which monitors how people reach its services. The adoption of IPv6 around the world is patchy, as some nations have deployed it widely while others have ignored it. Belgium tops the table of most enthusiastic IPv6 adopters, as 44.3% of people in that country can use it to get at Google and other IPv6 sites. Adoption in the US is 25.6% and the UK 2.95%. Obscure legacy The net has grown largely on the back of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which can support a total of four billion addresses. But the massive growth of the net has meant almost all of these older identifiers have now been used up. Everything connected to the net needs an address to ensure that data reaches the right destination. The basic syntax of Internet Protocol version 6 was first agreed 20 years ago, but only in December 2015 did use of it hit 10%, according to Google is figures. Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, said now that IPv4 had run out, many people were taking IPv6 a lot more seriously. \"Major sites such as Facebook and Google have adopted IPv6, and pretty much any web site could be using IPv6 now,\" he told the BBC. \"This means that people that have IPv6 on their devices, as well as IPv4, can now use IPv6 in preference.\" Mobile networks are among the biggest users of IPv6, because most modern smartphones are equipped for it. The vast majority of people online still connect via IPv4, and some ISPs use technology in their networks to translate between the two. Some are pushing on with projects to convert their networks to IPv6 - in the UK, BT has said its entire network will be able to use IPv6 by the end of 2016. Running both IPv4 and IPv6 had its problems, said Mr Kennard, though few noticed it as the basic tasks of visiting websites were rarely affected by the internal technology. \"However, sharing IPv4 addresses does stifle innovation and development of new applications and protocols,\" he said. \"Eventually IPv4 will be some obscure legacy thing, still lingering on a bit,\" he added. \"Sadly, we are probably many years away from that.\"\",\"But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the government remained committed to the target. He said the aim was to get net migration down to \"sustainable\" levels. The final version of the much-delayed immigration plan, which aims to end free movement from the EU after Brexit, has yet to be agreed. Ministers had insisted it would be issued this week, before the Christmas break, but it is unclear if that will now happen as officials work round the clock to finalise the plans. The goal of cutting net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - was introduced by David Cameron in 2011 and was a Conservative manifesto commitment at last year is general election. The BBC is Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said removing it from the immigration white paper would be a \"hugely symbolic step\". The government has never come close to meeting the target and has faced repeated calls to drop it. The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has fallen since Britain voted to leave the EU, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged and stands at 273,000 a year. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will reportedly use the immigration white paper to set out plans to cut net migration from the EU by as much as 80%. He wants to limit the number of low and medium-skilled workers coming to the UK from EU countries by saying they must earn at least £30,000 a year. But there will be no cap on the number of highly skilled workers, reports suggest. This will create a level playing field with immigration from outside the EU, the government says. But some businesses have warned of labour shortages, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark are arguing for the proposed £30,000 minimum salary for low-skilled workers to be reduced, according to The Daily Mail. Why 'net migration'? By Political Reporter Brian Wheeler The Conservatives went into the 2010 general election with a pledge to return to the \"sustainable\" levels of net migration seen in the 1990s. David Cameron promised to meet the target \"no ifs, no buts\". But the idea has always had its critics. A country can only control how many people come in, not how many emigrate. And Mr Cameron only had limited control over those coming in anyway, because of EU free movement rules. But focusing on net migration did shift attention away from the far higher immigration figure - 630,000 in 2017 - which had previously dominated the headlines. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to speculate on the contents of the draft white paper, which have been shown to the cabinet for the first time this week. He told BBC Radio 4 is Today programme: \"We are committed to seeing net migration reduced to those sustainable numbers that we saw back before 1998 when it was less than 100,000.\" He said the government had focused on that number \"because that is what is sustainable in the long-term\". Global employment consultancy Mercer has predicted a UK workforce shortage of 1.9 million by 2025, if the government remains committed to its 100,000 target and demand for labour continues to rise at the same rate as it has for the past 10 years. But the company claims there is an \"untapped\" workforce of 1.8 million UK-born workers, if firms started recruiting more workers aged over 50, women, and people with disabilities.\",\"Sarah Emmott had her failing kidneys removed at the end of February but four weeks later her planned surgery from a live donor was put on hold. She is now having to undergo dialysis three times a week to keep her alive. Mother Ellie said: \"We'd put so much work into finding a match for her and now we feel we are back to square one.\" The youngster, who has a rare genetic kidney disease, needs a live kidney, which means it must come from a living person who can donate one. Many of her family members have been tested but none was found to be a match and so an appeal for a donor was started. After one was found, Sarah had her kidneys removed in preparation for the transplant but then it was put on hold, like many transplant cases classed as \"non-urgent\", because of the pandemic. Ms Emmott said: \"We had this fantastic plan in place, everything should have happened within four weeks but now we are just left where she is no kidneys and is relying on dialysis.\" The family, from Tadcaster, said they were hopeful the original donor could still eventually be used but they were faced with many uncertainties. Father Andy said: \"It is not only limbo for us, but for Sarah too. \"She cannot do anything, she cannot get on with her life... It is prolonging her being able to be a normal little girl.\" Fiona Loud, policy director for Kidney Care UK, said although it had had a big impact on affected families, postponing transplants was the \"right approach\". \"Now the six weeks is over, let us look what at we can do to be able to reopen that door and to be able to help people receive that life transforming transplant.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

On that occasion, it tolled every minute for 56 strokes for the funeral of King George VI. Friday is event will be part of an art project encouraging everyone across the UK to ring a bell at 08:12 on Friday. It was conceived by Turner Prize-winner Martin Creed, who has called the event Work No. 1197: All the bells in a country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes. Organisers hope it will set a world record for the largest number of bells rung simultaneously. For its part, Big Ben will have to be rung by hand, unlike the hourly chimes, which are automated. All The Bells will involve church bells, doorbells, cowbells and more - with events planned around the country. In Coventry, cyclists will gather outside the Transport Museum to ring their bicycle bells Scientists from the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey will also be taking part - even though they have no bells in their research station. Instead, they will be \"ringing\" and banging whatever they can lay their hands on, from kitchen pots to bedpans. Other participants include the Royal Navy, HMS Belfast, British Embassies worldwide and the famous Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Bells will be sounded in Britain is northernmost inhabited house in Skaw, the Shetland Isles, and the UK is most westerly church in Tresco, The Scilly Isles. It has also been confirmed that the National Assembly for Wales will be ringing its bell along with Stormont and the Scottish Parliament - meaning all four Parliaments are taking part.

Big Ben Facts\",\"By Daniel Wainwright & Rob EnglandBBC News Charity Feeding Britain said it was working with schools to provide meals for parents to take home. Others are planning to provide food packages to leave on the doorsteps of self-isolating families. The prime minister said the government will help parents by providing vouchers to those who receive free school meals. Schools in England will close on Friday except for looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable children. It comes after Scotland and Wales said schools would close from the same day. Almost 1.3 million children, about 15% of those in England is state schools, receive free school meals because they come from low income families. Official data showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where more than one in four pupils were entitled to free meals. Schools and community centre kitchens are being lined up to prepare meals for children who would normally get one for free during term time. However, Andrew Forsey, of Feeding Britain, said its usual Easter holiday activities, involving crafts and games, would not go ahead. The charity is already working with a \"core group\" of schools to use their canteens to produce the meals, whereas in normal holidays they would remain closed. Its plans would see schools offer hot meals for parents to collect and take home. Others would offer \"cold but nutritious meals\" and in some cases \"particularly vulnerable\" families would have them delivered. The charity operates in parts of Yorkshire, Merseyside, Cheshire, Coventry, Bristol, Cornwall, South Shields, Derbyshire and Leicester. Mr Forsey said: \"In a school holiday it is normally a mix of food and activities for children, who have meals together but also some cooking and food-related activities, arts and crafts.\" \"We'd also deliver food through community events, whereas under these plans we would have to work on the sole purpose of food.\" Angie Comerford, who works at Hebburn Helps, provides breakfast and lunches to school children during the holidays and said the charity would approach school closures like a \"long Easter holiday\". It provides hot meals and activities for children across South Tyneside, but as a result of high demand and many families self-isolating, they will only be providing packed lunches to Hebburn and Jarrow. \"We've got a couple of families who have had to self-isolate, but also kids who have got underlying health issues,\" Ms Comerford said, adding volunteers were leaving food at doorsteps for them to collect. In a normal six-week summer holiday, they would provide 1,800 packed lunches. \"To be honest I have not got a clue what it will be this time,\" Ms Comerford said. \"We do have a couple of quid in the pot, but if anyone can pitch in by providing food or chuck us a couple a quid, that would be good.\" Vouchers Pupils on free school meals at 25 Co-op Academy schools will be given a £20 voucher for each week of unplanned closure to spend at Co-op supermarkets, chief executive Steve Murrells said. Food charity Fareshare said it was expecting to see a big demand for the services supporting children who, \"as a result of no longer having access to free school meals, will be at much greater risk of hunger and malnutrition\". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said provision was being made to \"supply meals and vouchers\" to children on free school meals. \"Where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear that we will reimburse the cost,\" he said.\",\"By Richard HaughBBC News At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was confined to the bed of his bungalow in Ipswich. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) but says he will be \"stuck in limbo\" until the excess skin is removed. \"I want health professionals to have a look and think 'it is about time we helped this chap',\" he said. Mr Mason, 52, who had gastric bypass surgery in 2010, says his \"goal weight\" is 15 stone (95kg). 'Skin splitting' He said about eight stone (50kg) would be lost if he could have the three operations he needs to remove loose skin around his midriff, legs and under his arms. \"Around my middle and on my legs the skin keeps splitting because of the weight of it,\" Mr Mason said. \"I have got myself a little bit of independence and want to carry that on to where I do not need a wheelchair to get around.\" He said he decided to undress for the photographs because he had given up hope of the NHS offering him the surgery, which he says could cost more than £60,000 in total. \"I wonder if it will ever happen now,\" he said. \"I met a lady the other day who has been waiting 13 years and she is only got about two stone of loose skin to be removed.\" The NHS says Mr Mason has to have a stable weight for two years before the skin removal operations can be considered. Mr Mason said he had never seen \"proper photos\" of the back and front of himself and admitted that some people might find the images \"shocking\". \"I wanted people to see the issues that can happen to your body, to your skin, when you put an extreme amount of weight on,\" Mr Mason said. \"A lot of people think that is just going to shrink back, but it does not. \"If people find it shocking, perhaps they will think twice that they must not get themselves in that state.\" Samantha Scholtz, a consultant liaison psychiatrist working in the bariatric (treatment of obesity) service at St Mary is Hospital in west London, said excess skin was an issue for a lot of patients. 'Self-image' \"It is an under-recognised issue and something patients before going to surgery are not always informed about,\" she said. \"Although health is the main motivator for seeking surgery, I think the cosmetic appearance does come into it. \"It certainly affects their quality of life, self-image and their ability to form relationships.\" Ms Scholtz said she could not comment on Mr Mason specifically, but said it would be \"unfair\" to allow a patient to wait two years for an operation if that person was suffering from other complaints such as tears to the skin. But she added it was important for patients to get to a \"stable weight\" before having the skin removed. \"If they are still losing weight they will be left with more excess skin,\" she said. The NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said decisions about surgery were taken in the \"best interest\" of patients. \"In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people, including clinicians, who decide whether the patient should have such an operation,\" a spokesperson said. \"A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered.\"\",\"UKIP, the Lib Dems and Greens all gained their first seats on the council and the Conservatives also took seats at Labour is expense. Council leader Graeme Miller blamed the loss of 12 seats since 2015 on Labour MPs supporting a fresh vote on Brexit. Labour is Jamie Driscoll won 33.9% of the mayoral votes. Mr Driscoll, who will head the newly formed North of Tyne Combined Authority, said: \"This victory on the North of Tyne is a verdict on positive campaigning on clear socialist policies. \"The Tory party has been rejected, not simply for fumbling the Brexit negotiations.\" He added it was a verdict \"on a derelict government\". In Sunderland, Mr Miller said he had seen a \"massive voter protest\" over Brexit. He added: \"Sunderland voted as a city to leave and having had a message from MPs saying we have to have a people is vote and a second referendum, people are saying we are not just accepting that in the Labour party. \"I have lost councillors tonight because of this - the Brexit message has stepped into local politics and that is the outcome. \"Hopefully the party will learn from it and will not make that mistake again.\" However, Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, tweeted: \"Losses to different parties across city tells us this is not a simple Brexit story.\" Labour also lost five seats in South Tyneside and two in Newcastle, as it held on to both councils. It also held on to North Tyneside, where it lost one seat to the Conservatives.

But her work faded into obscurity after her death in 1953. Much of it was thought to be lost, until a cache of music was found in her former summer house in Chicago in 2009. Musicologist Samantha Ege has spent the past two years trawling through those archives to reconstruct her solo piano pieces. Among them was Fantasie Nègre No 3 in F Minor, which was long presumed to be incomplete. 'Gathering dust' \"The music just ended after two pages really abruptly,\" Ege told the BBC. She made it her mission to find the missing pieces in Price is archive, which is now held in the University of Arkansas. The problem was that, while the piece starts in F minor, the second page ends in a different key - A♭ major. Using Price is previous compositions as a template, Ege assumed the Fantasie would return to the original key in its closing passages. \"I tried to imagine where the music could go,\" she said. \"But I did not have a piano with the late 19th Century Romantic tradition,\" she said. \"The first Fantasy Nègre is based on a spiritual, Please Don't Let This Harvest Pass... and I think of each one as different chapters in a very elaborate novel. \"Even though they were never published during her lifetime, she wrote them down and noted that they were some of her most worthy compositions, and so it is really moving to be able to bring that together and perform them together.\" Composer is story Ege is work is the latest chapter in the rediscovery and reappraisal of Price is work. She was born Florence Smith in 1887 in Little Rock, Arkansas, to a dentist father and piano teacher mother, who encouraged her to take up the instrument. She went on to study at the New England Conservatory of Music, one of the few music schools to accept black students at the time, and earned two diplomas in piano and organ. By 1910, she was head of the music department at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1912, she married Thomas J Price and they moved back to her home town - but racial tensions were on the rise and, after a public lynching in 1927, the family moved to Chicago. When her husband struggled to find work, the couple divorced, but Price retained her married name and made ends meet by teaching piano, playing the organ for silent film screenings and writing advertising jingles under the name Vee Jay. At the same time, she started entering composing competitions, winning several prizes. Her big break came in 1932, when her First Symphony won the orchestral category in the Wanamaker Music Composition Contest. That caught the attention of conductor Frederick Stock, who premiered the symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the following year. Despite that success, she often struggled to get her music played in a more sexist and segregated era. It was a problem she acknowledged in a 1943 letter to the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, asking him to consider performing her music. \"I have two handicaps,\" she wrote. \"I am a woman and I have some Negro blood in my veins.\" She continued to write, and her music was performed in concert halls in Detroit, Michigan, and Brooklyn, New York. The contralto Marian Anderson also sang Price is arrangement of My Soul is Been Anchored in De Lord as the closing song of her historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC in 1939. After her death in 1953, Price is music was largely overlooked by the classical music establishment, but her reputation was preserved by black musicians and newspapers, which championed her legacy. The discovery of her archive in 2009 helped bring her music to wider audiences again, with BBC Radio 3 dedicating a five-part documentary to her story last year. Ege said there were many more works in Price is repertoire that remain to be recorded and publicised - and with the first festival dedicated to the composer due to take place later this year, she hopes her place in the classical music canon will be maintained. \"These pieces now need to be performed, and we need to hear them, so that we can we can appreciate Florence Price today, not just in terms of her history, but in terms of the works and the artistry that she created,\" she said.

These could include a children is playground or a victim is home. Around 800 people are currently the subject of electronic monitoring in Scotland. They wear tags either because they have been released early from prison or are on community sentences. Advances in technology These tags work with a specific radio frequency, but advances in GPS technology developed in North America and Scandinavia appear to be more flexible and effective. Ministers believe individually-tailored electronic monitoring can help reduce reoffending, by allowing offenders to maintain family connections and employment. It comes as more than 100 experts meet in Perth to examine how Scotland could use advances in technology, including GPS, to improve the monitoring of offenders. The conference has been organised as part of work being undertaken by a specially appointed Electronic Monitoring in Scotland Working Group, which is due to report to Scottish Ministers next year. The event coincides with a new report from the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, which has found evidence that adopting GPS technology in addition to the current radio frequency method could be beneficial. 'Vehicle theft' The research has explored the potential uses of GPS monitoring for a number of offence types, including domestic abuse, alcohol, sexual crimes, drug-related crimes and vehicle theft. Speaking at the conference, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"For more than ten years we have successfully used radio frequency technology in electronic monitoring and our current approach is working. \"However, I am keen to explore how we could make use of the latest in emerging technologies, such as GPS. \"On the face of it, GPS technology appears to offer potential opportunities for the management of sex offenders or to be used in cases of domestic abuse.\"\",\"Visitors have spent an extra £1.3m in Bradford in the six months since City Park opened, figures compiled independently for the authority show. About 220,000 people visited, between March and the start of September, the study indicated. Businesses near the park say they have seen an upturn in trade since March. The figures were compiled for Bradford City Council by independent economic consultants Ekosgen. 'Vibrant space' Bradford is Kirkgate shopping centre reported \"a significant increase in footfall\" since the opening of the City Park, the council said. And one business close to the park, the Dragon Thai restaurant, said trade was up by about 40% since it opened. Susan Hinchcliffe, Bradford Council is portfolio holder for employment, skills and culture, said the statistics gave investors a good reason to come to the city. \"It is a catalyst for change and a key part of our regeneration,\" she said. \"It is a really vibrant space now and that is reflected in the figures.\" The City Park is a scaled down version of one proposed as part of a masterplan for Bradford city centre in 2003. It features a 3,600 sq m (43,060 sq ft) mirror pool and 100 fountains. The original scheme involved building a lake around the Victorian Grade I listed City Hall. It was funded by Bradford council, the now abolished regional development agency Yorkshire Forward and the Regional Transport Board.\",\"Dante Mullings died at the scene after being shot in St Vincent Street West in the Ladywood area of Birmingham at about 17:00 BST on Tuesday. His family described him as the \"epitome of kind, caring and thoughtful\". Two other men, aged 19 and 20, were also hurt. The 19-year-old remains in hospital but the other was discharged. No arrests have yet been made. West Midlands Police detectives believe Mr Mullings and the two other victims were in a silver Vauxhall Corsa when they were shot at from an oncoming car. They managed to exit the car, police said, but Mr Mullings collapsed a short distance away. A post-mortem examination found he died from a gunshot wound. Witnesses said they saw three men in balaclavas firing at the victims from a car. Police said they were still trying to establish the circumstances of the attack urged witnesses to come forward. Mr Mullings' family said they were \"broken beyond belief\", adding he would be \"terribly missed\". \"Not only is murder is a huge loss to our family but also a considerable loss to the community,\" their statement said.

But Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export ban on the statue, and Arts Council England says \"it is possible\" a new buyer within the UK may be found. The current owner is identity and location have not been released. The council said the temporary bar had \"no impact\" on the sale of the statue, which had been in its possession since 1880 and was put to auction in July to fund an extension of the town is museum and art gallery. A spokeswoman said it was up to the \"current owner, Arts Council England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to resolve\". Protesters gathered outside Christie is before the sale, the council has since been banned from the Museums Association and has had a Heritage Lottery Fund bid rejected as a consequence. Mr Vaizey decided to bar the export following a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), which is administered by Arts Council England. The RCEWA said the statue was of \"outstanding aesthetic importance\" and was significant in the study of \"the development of private statuary and funerary religion in Egypt and the history of human self-representation\". A decision on the export licence application has been deferred until 29 July. Arts Council England said there was a chance the statue could be sold to a buyer within the UK, if \"a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made at the recommended price of £15,732,600 plus VAT\". Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy had condemned the sale as an \"an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property\". He said the statue of Sekhemka, who was a royal chief, judge and administrator, should have been handed back to Egypt if the council no longer wanted it.\",\"Northumbrian Water is placing protective screens at six places on the Tees, Tyne, Wear and Coquet in response to new regulations. The £11m project aims to be completed by March 2020. Work has started at the Lumley pumping station on the Wear in Chester-le-Street. Numbers of European eels have dramatically dropped since the 1980s. Michael Walsh, Northumbrian Water project manager, said: \"It is not known exactly why there is been such a dramatic decline, but this project will help ensure the safe passage of eels in our region and ultimately, I hope, will contribute to restoring populations.\" Robbie Stevenson, from the Environment Agency, described the eels as \"fascinating creatures\". He added: \"They have a complex life cycle, beginning life in the Sargasso sea and undergoing several changes during their life maturing in European waters, before returning to the Sargasso to spawn.\"\",...,\"It is the third day in a row that an apple has returned untouched in my son is packed lunch. Still rosy red, but increasingly sticky and lightly bruised from its travels, I wonder whether to send it back a fourth time with a Post-it note saying, 'Eat me or else!' in the vain hope that he might actually munch it. \"Why would I eat something that is been in my lunch box for four days, Mum?\" the seven-year-old says in genuine puzzlement. Too tired to argue, I accept he has a point, and replace it with a fresh plum and some cherries, knowing full well they will return in a mushy mess tonight. Why does this boomeranging buffet make me feel like such a failure as a parent? And why is the simple task of packing my children off with a box full of grub such a painful one? When animals feed their young, it seems such an uncomplicated transaction. And yet for we grown-ups, with all our human intelligence and fistfuls of nutritional guidelines, it is extraordinarily tricky. Perhaps that is it - parents and schools' well-intentioned packed-lunch policies are over-complicating it. There can be a fine line between healthy eating and eating disorders, in my view, and sometimes the disorder is a group malaise rather than one belonging to an individual. And it seems I am not alone in torturing myself over my children is packed lunches. Mother-of-three Olivia says: \"I must be ridiculous to the extreme, as all three of mine have packed lunches, and I am not one that will prepare the night before, as I like the thought that their sandwiches are as fresh as possible. \"One has the crusts cut off. James cried so much about not wanting to eat the crusts that his teacher suggested cutting them off... not done at home. \"The other two want only half a sandwich because they are incredibly slow eaters and if they do not finish quickly enough it cuts into their precious playtime!\" She adds: \"Recently my husband sent me an article highlighting the evils of processed meats so for a while I was cooking roasts for cold cuts. I soon reverted to type and bought the processed once again.\" Guilty secret We all try as parents to do our best, and keep it homemade. There are certainly enough celebrity chefs telling us how easy it is to combine cooking from scratch with busy working and family lives - with just a tiny bit of preparation. What they forget is that they cook for a living. In reality, not all of us can manage it, nor, perhaps, should we feel obliged to when a nice, shiny machine in a factory can do just as good a job. Nonetheless, my guiltiest packed lunch secret is sending my son to school with a supermarket-made item, such as a cheese and pasta salad. For some reason it goes down better than a homemade one. Maybe it is the vast quantities of artificial flavourings and Xanthum gum that give it the edge. But I am too embarrassed to leave it in its original packaging, in case it gets out that I am a bit lazy, and so transfer it into plastic box to pass it off as my own. Even when we do cook it all from scratch, our valiant efforts can end up in a ticking-off from the school support staff - or even our own children. Rachel is well-meaning attempt at something new and healthy says it all. Choc-chip contraband \"I once packed the girls off with a Tupperware full of pasta and pesto (freshly made!) - thinking I was giving them a nice change - only to be read the riot act when they got back as it contained nuts!\" She says her two daughters reacted differently. \"One was traumatised by the episode and was concerned she would be labelled for life - particularly given a girl in her class has an extreme nut allergy. While the other seemed to enjoy the illicitness of eating the forbidden food.\" And she is not the first mother to be sent crazy by nuts. Mother-of-one and college lecturer Julie received an urgent summons while at work one day from her daughter is school, saying: \"You've sent her to school with peanut butter sandwiches. Do you realise what you have done?\" Mother-of-one Ruth wonders whether school rules about healthy eating are more about testing the parents' stamina. She says: \"Sometimes all you want to do is send your child to school with a massive triple-tiered chocolate fudge cake in their lunch box to share with all their friends before the dinner police can drag it away!\" The truth is we all wander the shopping aisles in search of inspiration, but many of us end up with the same old familiar items. And while it may fuel parents' guilt because we feel we are not offering the most nutritionally varied diet, for many children that familiarity breeds contentment. Helen says: \"Maddie seems to have the same thing day in, day out. She should be bored senseless but is adamant it is fine. \"She steadfastly refuses to have anything naughty, in case she gets told off. I have tried to put a choc-chip biscuit or jam sandwiches in but she tells me off.\" If only things were as simple in my home, where my son launches nightly raids on the treats cupboard while I am bathing his sister. After all, the packed lunch is surely an extension of the family dinner table where today is battles-of-will can end in the fussy eating of tomorrow. As Dr Christopher Green, author of parent handbook Toddler Taming writes: \"We can choose the healthiest designer diet, put it on a plate, even get it into the toddler is mouth, but if they decide that is as far as it is going - checkmate - game over.\" Although experience has taught me there is no point in forcing it, I just cannot help myself.\",\"Six men were found guilty on Wednesday of a string of sex offences following a five-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court. There had previously been a restriction on naming Mohammed Ashan, 35, who pleaded guilty to indecent assault charges before the trial began. He will be sentenced at a later date. Ashan, of HMP Wymott, admitted three counts of indecent assault against girls under the age of 16. Abid Saddiq, 38, was convicted on Wednesday of two counts of rape, five of indecent assault, and two of child abduction. Sharaz Hussain, 35, Masaued Malik, 35, and Aftab Hussain, 40, were found guilty of indecent assault. Two other defendants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of rape and indecent assault. The court heard the men abused their victims between 1998 and 2002. Five of the six are due to be sentenced on Friday. The convictions are the latest to arise from Operation Stovewood, a major National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation. It looked into sexual abuse and exploitation in Rotherham covering the years 1997 to 2013. The agency has said it believes 1,510 teenagers were exploited in the town during the period.

Some workers had been left stranded in the country, working for as little as $0.85 a day (50p), The Guardian said. In May, Qatar vowed to improve the rights of migrants in the Gulf state amid growing alarm at their treatment. But an investigation by the British newspaper found migrants who had worked on the Qatar 2022 offices in the Al Bidda skyscraper in Doha were still waiting for their pay. The project, which The Guardian says was commissioned by the Qatari government, was carried out by migrants working for the contractor Lee Trading. It cost $4.25m (£2.5m) and the offices were fitted with expensive etched glass and handmade Italian furniture. But Lee Trading is collapse led to Amnesty International raising the case with Qatar is prime minister last November after many of the workers were left stranded. The situation has remained the same and five of the workers have since been arrested and imprisoned after being left without ID papers. In a statement released on Monday, Qatar 2022 said it was \"heavily dismayed to learn of the behaviour of Lee Trading with regard to the timely payment of its workers.\" Officials said they relayed the concerns raised by Amnesty to the \"relevant authorities\" last year and insisted they would \"continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases.\" Qatar moved to change controversial laws on foreign workers in May that tied migrant workers to a single employer. Human rights campaigners had accused that sponsorship system of being akin to modern-day slavery. The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country.\",\"The nursery school teacher was stabbed by Sudesh Amman, 20, on Streatham High Road on Sunday afternoon. Amman had previously been convicted of terror offences and was shot dead by police who were monitoring him. Mrs Luftner, a teacher at St Bede is Catholic Infant and Nursery School in Balham, is recovering at home with her partner. In a statement, the school said Mrs Luftner was making \"a good recovery\" and asked that her privacy be respected. Amman stabbed two people on busy Streatham High Road, in south London, before being shot dead by police just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. He is reported to have been \"under active police surveillance\" at the time of the attack, and was later found wearing a \"hoax\" suicide device. It emerged that Amman had recently been released from prison after serving half of his three year sentence for terror-related offences. Police later declared the incident \"terrorist-related\". Officers said the condition of the second stabbing victim - a man in his 40s - was initially considered life-threatening, but he is now in a serious but stable condition. A woman in her 20s received minor injuries - believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of a police firearm - and has been discharged from hospital.\",\"More than 14,000 hate crimes were recorded between July and September. In 10 forces the number of suspected hate crimes increased by more than 50%, compared to the previous three months. Police say their own monitoring suggests incidents have levelled out after the summer is spike. Last October the Home Office published provisional figures which suggested the number of hate crimes in July 2016 had been 41% higher than 12 months earlier. Those 5,468 reports indicated there had been a spike in reports - supporting anecdotal evidence across the country of an increased number of threatening, violent or abusive incidents. The fresh data compiled by the Press Association comes from official statistics which include detailed figures for five core crimes which are deemed to be racially or religiously aggravated, ranging from assaults through to criminal damage. In the three months to September 2016, 33 of the 44 forces in England and Wales saw their highest levels of hate crimes since comparable records began in 2012. 'Robust approach' Dorset and Nottinghamshire saw the highest percentage increases in reports - 100% and 75% respectively - compared to the levels seen between March and the end of June. That previous period had included the referendum campaign itself and the week immediately after the vote. The Metropolitan Police in London recorded the highest number of hates crimes, with 3,356 in that period, while Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire Police recorded 1,033 and 1,013 respectively. South Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Surrey and City of London Police posted falls in hate crime. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, the National Police Chiefs' Council is lead for hate crime, said: \"We know that national and global events have the potential to trigger short-terms rises in hate crime and we saw this following the EU referendum last year. \"Police forces took a robust approach to these crimes and reporting returned to previously seen levels. \"These numbers are still far too high. We have increased the central reporting and monitoring functions to enable us to recognise spikes earlier. This will be used to assess any threats that may arise and inform local police activity.\" So what does this mean in the long-term? Analysis by Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent While the overall figure from this analysis comes to 14,300 hate crimes in three months, it cannot confidently be claimed as a quarterly national record across the UK because of the complicated way that hate crimes are counted. There is no doubt there was a spike after the Brexit vote, but the long-term picture will not become clear for months. And if 2016 turns out to be a record year, there still needs to be some caution about what the figures mean. Sexual offences rose in recent years thanks to more people coming forward to report what had happened to them. If there is a long-term rise in hate crime recorded by police, it may simply reflect that victims have more confidence that it is worth speaking to the police. But David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, warned that many people remained anxious. \"It must be sensible to prepare for any possible spikes during the Brexit process,\" he said. \"The triggering of Article 50 is the next major milestone and we must do all we can to discourage hate attacks and to support people who feel at risk.\" Fizza Qureshi of Migrants' Rights Network, a campaign group that runs an online service encouraging people to report hate crimes and have them recorded on a real-time map, said: \"The experience of thousands of people in the UK of discrimination, hostility and at times violence is invisible to many people in Britain - but today is figures lay it bare for all to see.\"\"]]\n",
